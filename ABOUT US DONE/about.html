            <h2>There Is A Cosy</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Cosy Air Conditioners is presented as a retailer/distributor of air-conditioning units — they appear to resell ACs of major brands and also handle installation themselves. Their website suggests they offer a variety of split and cassette ACs, presumably with installation support via their own teams rather than third-party contractors.

However — it’s hard to verify detailed credentials (like manufacturing, warranty, or long-term service reliability) for “Cosy Air Conditioners.” Their online presence looks modest compared with large established brands, and there is limited independent documentation confirming their track record in Pakistan’s HVAC market.</p>

            <h2>History Of Cosy</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Cosy Air Conditioners appears to have established itself by at least 2016 — their website shows “© 2016” in the footer. 
cosy-air-conditioners.netlify.app

 Their listed contact address is “Progressive Center, Main Shahrah-e-Faisal, Karachi.”

 From that site, Cosy projects itself as a full-service AC supplier and installer: they claim to “buy direct from the manufacturer,” and provide their “own installation teams” rather than relying on third-party contractors.

Since its founding, Cosy AC seems to have positioned itself not simply as a retailer, but as a one-stop solutions provider — offering sales, installation, warranty, and after-sales support bundled together under their own brand identity.

 However — because public records about Cosy (e.g. founding date, company registration details, long-term track record) are scarce — much of this “history” is based on what the company itself publishes online rather than independent documentation. If you like — I can try to find third-party records or reviews confirming when Cosy started operations in Karachi (or elsewhere in Pakistan).</p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 165px;">About us</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Cosy Air Conditioners presents itself as a full-service HVAC retailer and installer operating out of Karachi. On their website, they display a catalog of air-conditioner units (split ACs, cassette ACs, etc.) from major brands such as LG, Mitsubishi, Carrier, Sanyo and others — typically offering sales, installation, and warranty support under one roof.

 They claim to “buy direct from the manufacturer,” use their “own installation teams,” and guarantee a quality-assured installation. 
cosy-air-conditioners.netlify.app
 This suggests that Cosy AC aims to position itself not merely as a reseller but as a one-stop air-conditioning solutions provider for homes and businesses.

On their website, Cosy promises 24/7 client support, “100% satisfaction guarantee,” transparent pricing (no hidden costs), and a “fast service, no mucking around” approach for quotes and installation. 
cosy-air-conditioners.netlify.app
 They also emphasize reliability and after-sales service as part of their selling proposition: warranty protections for installed units and a service-center meant to respond whenever customers need help. 
cosy-air-conditioners.netlify.app
 This kind of full-service offering can be appealing in a market like Karachi, where customers often value not just the AC unit but reliable installation and maintenance.

That said — publicly available information about Cosy AC is limited. Their website is modest, and there seems to be no widely available independent documentation (in media, business registries, or consumer-review portals) confirming long-term track record, years in operation, or customer satisfaction beyond what they claim. Because of this scarcity of independent verification, it’s difficult to assess how well they deliver on their promises over time (installation quality, after-sale support, warranty fulfillment, etc.). In short: while Cosy AC markets itself as a trustworthy, full-service AC provider with a broad selection and installation support, there is insufficient public evidence to fully confirm its reliability or reputation in the long term.
